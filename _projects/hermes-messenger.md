This is a messaging network based on the principle of having a lot of small, cheap servers (such as raspberry pi's) to handle the traffic, taking over the domain if the one that was assigned fails. This is huge project thats been developed since last october by a group of teenagers like me. Find us in the `main-dev` team in the Hermes Messenger organization on GitHub, where all the projects making this work are hosted.
