# About me
I'm a teenager and a developer, passionate about all things technology related. I like light electronics like arduino, and would like to get into the security stuff. For now my projects are all over the place, ranging from a messaging network to a Kerbal Space Program arduino controller, even a simulated CPU (Armes CPU).

# About the site
In this site I'd like to share my projects and findings. I'll try to post regularly about whatever I'm working in at that moment.

I wan't this to become somewhere where I can share the little knowledge I have with whoever wants to read it. I want also to share here what I learn along the years, so it can maybe even help someone (seems pretty unlikely to me, but whatever I can say what I want ðŸ™ƒ).
I hope you like the page and the idea I have to use it.
